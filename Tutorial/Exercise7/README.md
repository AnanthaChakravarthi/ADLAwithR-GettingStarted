# Exercise 7

In this exercise we will train a simple model and save it. Then we will deploy this trained model and use it for predictions.


In `usqlscript7a.usql` we will train a linear model, serialize the trained model and save it.

In `usqlscript7b.usql` we will deploy the serialized trained model (created in usqlscript7a.usql) and use it for predictions.
