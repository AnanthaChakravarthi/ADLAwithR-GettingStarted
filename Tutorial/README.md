In this tutorial folder you will find a set of exercises to help you get started with using Azure Data Lake Analytics with R for Data Science work. Each Exercise folder contains usql and R scripts with description of the exercise. The advanced folder contains some more complex examples.

Note: Please provision Azure Data Lake Analytics Account and Data Lake Store in your Azure subscription by following the instructions [here](../Azure%20CLI/) in order to do the exercises below. Upload [myiris.csv](/Tutorial/Exercise1/) and [myiris_header.csv](../Tutorial/Exercise1/) to /TutorialMaterial folder in your Data Lake Store. These csv files will be used in most of the exercises.

#### [Exercise 1](../Tutorial/Exercise1/) - Inline R code.
#### [Exercise 2](../Tutorial/Exercise2/) - Deploy R script as resource.
#### [Exercise 3](../Tutorial/Exercise3/) - Check the R environment in ADLA. Install the magrittr package.
#### [Exercise 4](../Tutorial/Exercise4/) - Using checkpoint to create a zip file containing required packages and all the dependencies. Demonstrate how to deploy and use dplyr package.
#### [Exercise 5](../Tutorial/Exercise5/) - Understanding how partitioning works in ADLA. Specifically the REDUCE operation. 
#### [Exercise 6](../Tutorial/Exercise6/) - About rReturnType as “charactermatrix”.
#### [Exercise 7](../Tutorial/Exercise7/) - Save the trained model. Deploy trained model for scoring.
#### [Exercise 8](../Tutorial/Exercise8/) - Use R scripts as combiners (using COMBINE and Extension.R.Combiner).
#### [Exercise 9](../Tutorial/Exercise9/) - Use rxDTree() from RevoScaleR package.
#### [Advanced](../Tutorial/Advanced/)    - More complex examples.
